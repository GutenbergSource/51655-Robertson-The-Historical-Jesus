<HTML><BODY>In this volume, the author dives deeper into the positions on the historicity of the central figure in Christianity, Jesus. In this work, the author contemplates the various arguments for and against the theory that this person is merely a mythological figure, and no historical person corresponding to the accounts in the gospels -- even if you discount the miracles -- has ever existed.

<p>No particular difficulties expected for the proofreaders or formatters; an above average number of footnotes, and some foreign phrases and names.

<p>Have fun!
